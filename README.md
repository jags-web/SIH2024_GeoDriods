# Geodroids - Attendance Tracking App

## **Overview**
The **Geodroids** team is developing an innovative attendance tracking app that helps organizations streamline employee attendance using modern technology. This app ensures that attendance is tracked when users are inside a designated geofence, while also validating the user via facial recognition.

## **Features**
- **Geofence-based Attendance**: Track employee attendance when they enter or exit a specific geofenced area using GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular networks.
- **Facial Recognition**: Validate the userâ€™s identity through facial recognition technology to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Multiple Location Tracking**: Supports multiple attendance tracking methods (GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular) to ensure accurate logging in various scenarios.
- **Automated Check-ins and Check-outs**: Automatically logs the check-in and check-out times as users move in and out of the geofence.
- **Reports and Analytics**: Generate detailed attendance reports for administrators.
